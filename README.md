# U.S. Oil Production Visualization by State

In this project, I will visualize the history of oil production by state in the United States. I will create animated choropleth maps using Plotly Express, which will display the production of oil for each state over time. Every one second, the visualization will transition to the next year, allowing viewers to observe the changes in production over time.
